<a id="overview"></a><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Dialog is a domain-specific language for creating interactive fiction. It is
heavily inspired by Inform&nbsp;7 (Graham Nelson et al. 2006) and Prolog (Alain
Colmerauer et al. 1972), and substantially different from both.
</p>
<p>An optimizing compiler translates high-level Dialog code into Z-code
(version&nbsp;8), a platform-independent runtime format supported by a wide range of
interpreters and tools.
</p>
<p>Dialog has been designed with three guiding principles in mind:
</p>
<p class="indented"><b>Lucidity:</b> Story authors must be able to read, understand, and
modify the standard library. The same programming language constructs
should be used to express everything from world modelling and narrative
structure to parsing and low-level utility functions.
</p>
<p class="indented"><b>Minimalism:</b> The language should be elegant and small, and rest
on a few powerful concepts that work well together. Being a high-level
language, it should provide an abstraction of the underlying platform,
and the details of the Z-machine should not shine through except where
strictly necessary for performance reasons.
</p>
<p class="indented"><b>Performance:</b> The interactive fiction community settled on the
Z-machine as a common platform partly for nostalgic reasons. Yet the
majority of recent Z-code games are unplayable on vintage hardware. The
new language must be designed from the ground up with efficient object
code in mind, both in terms of execution speed and memory footprint.
</p>
<p>At its core, Dialog is a general-purpose, rule-based language in the <i>logic
programming</i> family of languages. Most of the functionality pertaining to
interactive storytelling, such as the world model and the parser, are
implemented on top of this general-purpose language, in the form of a standard
library. In other words, the library is implemented in terms of the same
high-level constructs that are used to craft the story. Hopefully, this makes
the standard library transparent to story authors, who are encouraged to extend
and adapt the library to each particular story, as they see fit.
</p>
<p>In addition to adhering to the principles listed above, Dialog features:
</p>
<ul><li>A <b>concise, formal syntax</b>. Apart from a few built-in keywords and
function names, Dialog source code is not confined to any particular
natural language.
</li>
<li>A <b>comprehensive standard library</b> providing (among other
features) an extensible parser that's capable of supporting arbitrarily
complex actions. The standard library is currently limited to English
stories, but it could be translated and adapted to other languages.
</li>
<li>A compiler that uses <b>advanced optimization</b> techniques to convert
high-level rule definitions into compact, efficient Z-code that
responds quickly to player input, even on resource-constrained
platforms&mdash;including many vintage systems.
</li>
<li>A <b>fully open-source</b> implementation, provided under a 2-clause
BSD license. Permission is granted to use, modify, and redistribute the
compiler and standard library (with or without source code), in whole
or in part, as long as attribution is given. Story authors are kindly
asked, but not formally required, to include a traditionally-formatted
banner in their works.
</li>
</ul><p>The name Dialog is suggestive of interactive storytelling, but it is also a nod
to Prolog, which is a portmanteau of <i>programmation en logique</i>
(programming in logic). That's why the name of the language appears to follow a
North American spelling convention, even though the rest of this manual does
not.

<a id="structmanual"></a><h2>Structure of the manual</h2>
<p>The bulk of this manual is divided into two parts: <b>Part&nbsp;I</b> describes the
Dialog programming language, starting with the basics and working its way
through every language feature. This also serves as the official language
specification. <b>Part&nbsp;II</b> describes the standard library, and starts with a
hands-on tutorial, where a small game is built from scratch.
</p>
<p>Readers who prefer a coherent step-by-step exposition, where every concept is
explained before it is used, are encouraged to start with <b>Part&nbsp;I</b> and
read all chapters in order.
</p>
<p>Readers who are itching to get started should begin with <b>Part&nbsp;II</b>, play
with the various examples, and optionally follow the hyperlinks back to
<b>Part&nbsp;I</b> in order to dig deeper into the underlying mechanisms.
</p>
<a id="acknowledgements"></a><h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>Dialog has been my on-and-off spare time project for many years now, and I'm
very happy to have reached a point where it can be released to the public.
Working on Dialog has been an extraordinary journey for me personally, but I
wouldn't have gotten very far without the maps and lanterns strewn about by the
brave adventurers who navigated these twisty passages before me.
</p>
<p>The <i>Z-machine Standards Document</i> has been an invaluable source of
information and insight. I stand in awe of the dozens of people who
reverse-engineered and documented the Z-machine back in the 1990s, and
described their findings in such a well-written and concise reference work.
Thank you for that

</p>
<p>Writing and debugging a compiler involves hours of staring at disassembled
code, and I thank <b>Mark Howell</b> and <b>Matthew Russotto</b> for creating
and maintaining the <span class="tt">ztools</span> package, in particular <span class="tt">infodump</span>
and <span class="tt">txd</span>.
</p>
<p>I've also used and abused the highly hackable Z-code interpreter
<span class="tt">dumbfrotz</span>, part of the <span class="tt">frotz</span> family, for which <b>Stefan
Jokisch</b>, <b>Galen Hazelwood</b>, <b>David Griffith</b>, and <b>Alembic
Petrofsky</b> deserve credit.
</p>
<p>Last but not least, I extend my deepest gratitude to <b>Graham Nelson</b> and
(where applicable) <b>Emily Short</b> for developing and releasing Inform&nbsp;6
and&nbsp;7, for writing the <i>Inform Designer's Manual</i> and <i>Writing with
Inform</i>, and for distilling so many years of community experience into the
default Inform world model and Standard Rules. These treasure troves are
overflowing with so many good ideas that it would have been irresponsible not
to steal a substantial part of them, and incorporate them into my own standard
library. Any shortcomings in the Dialog world model are of course my own fault.

<a id="typechecks"></a><h2>Checking the type of a value</h2>
<p>Dialog contains a set of built-in predicates for checking if a value is of a
particular type. They are:
</p>
<p class="codeline">(unbound $X)</p>
<p class="noteline">Succeeds if and only if <span class="code">$X</span> is currently an unbound variable.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(number $X)</p>
<p class="noteline">Succeeds if and only if <span class="code">$X</span> is bound to a number.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(word $X)</p>
<p class="noteline">Succeeds if and only if <span class="code">$X</span> is bound to a dictionary word.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(empty $X)</p>
<p class="noteline">Succeeds if and only if <span class="code">$X</span> is bound to an empty list.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(non-empty $X)</p>
<p class="noteline">Succeeds if and only if <span class="code">$X</span> is bound to a non-empty list.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(list $X)</p>
<p class="noteline">Succeeds if and only if <span class="code">$X</span> is bound to a list (empty or non-empty).
</p>
<p>The last one comes with an extra feature:
</p>
<p class="codeline">(object $X)</p>
<p class="noteline">If <span class="code">$X</span> is bound to an object, the query succeeds. If it is
bound to anything else, the query fails. But if <span class="code">$X</span> is
unbound, <span class="code">*(object $X)</span> backtracks over every object in the
game.
</p>
<a id="arithmetic"></a><h2>Numbers and arithmetic</h2>
<p>The Dialog language is designed for symbolic manipulation, predicate logic, and
storytelling. Arithmetic is possible, but the syntax is rather clunky.
</p>
<p class="codeline">($A plus $B into $C)</p>
<p class="noteline"><span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> must be bound to numbers;
<span class="code">C</span> is unified with their sum. If the result is outside the
valid range of numbers, the query fails.
</p>
<p class="codeline">($A minus $B into $C)</p>
<p class="noteline"><span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> must be bound to numbers;
<span class="code">C</span> is unified with their difference.  If the result is
outside the valid range of numbers, the query fails.
</p>
<p class="codeline">($A times $B into $C)</p>
<p class="noteline"><span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> must be bound to numbers;
<span class="code">C</span> is unified with their product. If the product is outside
the valid range of numbers, the query succeeds, but the numeric result
is unpredictable (i.e. it depends on the interpreter).
</p>
<p class="codeline">($A divided by $B into $C)</p>
<p class="noteline"><span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> must be bound to numbers;
<span class="code">C</span> is unified with the (integer) quotient after dividing
<span class="code">A</span> by <span class="code">B</span>. The query fails if <span class="code">B</span> is
zero.
</p>
<p class="codeline">($A modulo $B into $C)</p>
<p class="noteline"><span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> must be bound to numbers;
<span class="code">C</span> is unified with the remainder after dividing
<span class="code">A</span> by <span class="code">B</span>. The query fails if <span class="code">B</span> is
zero.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(random from $A to $B into $C)</p>
<p class="noteline"><span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> must be bound to numbers, such that
<span class="code">B</span> is greater than or equal to <span class="code">A</span>. A random
number in the range <span class="code">A</span> to <span class="code">B</span> (inclusive) is
picked, and then unified with <span class="code">C</span>.
</p>
<p class="codeline">($A &lt; $B)</p>
<p class="noteline">This predicate succeeds if and only if <span class="code">A</span> is numerically
less than <span class="code">B</span>.
</p>
<p class="codeline">($A &gt; $B)</p>
<p class="noteline">This predicate succeeds if and only if <span class="code">A</span> is numerically
greater than <span class="code">B</span>.
</p>
<p>Common to all of the above predicates is that they fail if <span class="code">A</span> or
<span class="code">B</span> is unbound, or bound to a non-number. <span class="code">C</span> may be
bound or unbound; it is unified with the result of the computation.
</p>
<p>To check for numerical equality, use regular unification, i.e. <span class="code">($&nbsp;=
$)</span>.
</p>
<p>All numbers in Dialog are restricted to the range <span class="nobreak">0&ndash;16383</span>
(inclusive). This range directly supports four-digit numbers such as years and
PIN codes. Pocket money should be fairly straightforward to implement by
counting in cents; story authors (or library developers) that require more
sophisticated number crunching will have to get creative.
</p>
<a id="styles"></a><h2>Styles and formatting</h2>
<p>To change the current text style, use the built-in predicates
<span class="code">(bold)</span>, <span class="code">(italic)</span>, <span class="code">(reverse)</span>, and
<span class="code">(fixed pitch)</span> to enable each respective style, and
<span class="code">(roman)</span> to disable all four.
</p>
<p>The built-in predicate <span class="code">(uppercase)</span> forces the next character to be
printed in uppercase. The standard library uses this to define a number of
convenient predicates such as:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy0" readonly>
(The $Obj)	(uppercase) (the $Obj)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="left">(The $Obj)</td><td class="right">(uppercase) (the $Obj)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy0').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>To clear the screen below the status bar area, use <span class="code">(clear)</span>. To
clear the entire screen and disable the status bar, use <span class="code">(clear
all)</span>. Be aware that on some interpreters, clearing interferes with the
player's ability to scroll back and review earlier parts of the play session.
</p>
<p>The built-in predicate <span class="code">(space&nbsp;$)</span> prints a given number of space
characters in succession.
</p>
<p>Its vertical counterpart, <span class="code">(par&nbsp;$)</span>, produces a paragraph break with
a height corresponding to the given number of blank lines. Adjacent paragraph
breaks are merged based on the maximum specified height, so
<span class="code">(par&nbsp;5)&nbsp;(par&nbsp;7)</span> produces seven blank lines.
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy1" readonly>
(program entry point)
	(clear all)
	(par 10)
	(space 10)
	(bold)
	This text is printed in bold, starting at row 11, column 11.
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">

</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy1').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<a id="input"></a><h2>Input</h2>
<p>User input is represented by dictionary words.
</p>
<p>The Dialog compiler collects all dictionary words mentioned explicitly in the
source code (with the <span class="nobreak"><span class="code">@</span>-prefix</span> or as bare words
inside lists), as well as every literal word that can come out of a
<span class="code">(collect words)</span> or <span class="code">(determine object $)</span> expression.
In addition, the system makes sure to provide a single-letter dictionary word
for every character supported by the underlying platform. Together, these words
make up what's called the <i>game-wide dictionary</i>.
</p>
<p>It may be helpful to know that there's a difference between dictionary words at
the Dialog level, and the native, low-level words of the Z-machine. Dialog
dictionary words are an abstraction over several different kinds of internal
representation. That being said, it is the specific constraints of the
low-level Z-machine dictionary that determine where the split occurs between
the essential and optional parts of a given dictionary word.
</p>
<p>There are two built-in predicates for obtaining input from the player. One
waits for a single keypress, while the other reads a full line of input.
</p>
<h3>Get key</h3>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy2" readonly>
	(get key $Char)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(get key $Char)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy2').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>This predicate waits for the player to type a character.
</p>
<p>Some interpreters indicate that the game is waiting for input by displaying a
flashing cursor. Others don't, so story authors may wish to prompt the reader
explicitly.
</p>
<p>The parameter, <span class="code">$Char</span>, is unified with a dictionary word
representing the character that was typed, e.g. <span class="code">@e</span> if the
<span class="prginput">E</span> key was pressed. Note that dictionary words are
case-insensitive, so for letters of the alphabet there is no way to tell
whether the player was holding shift or not.
</p>
<p>Some special keys correspond to dictionary words that can't be represented
directly in Dialog source code. The dictionary words for these keys can be
obtained at runtime, by querying the following built-in predicates:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy3" readonly>
(word representing return $Char)
(word representing space $Char)
(word representing backspace $Char)
(word representing up $Char)
(word representing down $Char)
(word representing left $Char)
(word representing right $Char)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(word representing return $Char)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(word representing space $Char)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(word representing backspace $Char)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(word representing up $Char)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(word representing down $Char)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(word representing left $Char)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(word representing right $Char)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy3').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>A simple keypress dispatcher might look like this:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy4" readonly>
(program entry point)
	(get key $Key)
	(handle keypress $Key)

(handle keypress @a)
	'A' was pressed.

(handle keypress @b)
	'B' was pressed.

(handle keypress (word representing return $))
	RETURN was pressed.
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(program entry point)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(get key $Key)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(handle keypress $Key)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="blank" colspan="2"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(handle keypress (word representing return $))</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">RETURN was pressed.</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy4').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<h3>Get input</h3>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy5" readonly>
	(get input $WordList)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(get input $WordList)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy5').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>This query blocks execution until the player types a line of input, followed by
return. Different interpreters provide different levels of line-editing
facilities, ranging from simple backspace handling all the way up to input
history and spell checking.
</p>
<p>The parameter, <span class="code">$WordList</span>, is unified with a list where each
element represents a word typed by the player. The punctuation characters full
stop, comma, double quote, semicolon, and asterisk are treated as individual
words; the remaining text is separated into words by whitespace. If a word is
recognized as one that appears in the program-wide dictionary, then the element
will be that dictionary word. Else, if the word is a decimal number in the
range <span class="nobreak">0&ndash;16383</span>, the element will be that number.
</p>
<p>If the word was neither recognized, nor found to be a decimal number, then
Dialog will attempt to remove certain word endings, and check whether the
remaining part of the word exists in the dictionary. This procedure is
necessary for games written in e.g. German, whereas English games generally do
not require it.
</p>
<p>To specify removable endings, add one or more rule definitions to the predicate
<span class="code">(removable word endings)</span>. Each rule body should consist of one or
more word endings:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy6" readonly>
(removable word endings)
	%% German adjective endings
	en es em e

(removable word endings)
	%% German noun endings
	e en s es
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(removable word endings)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="comment">%% German adjective endings</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">en es em e</td></tr>
<tr><td class="blank" colspan="2"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(removable word endings)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="comment">%% German noun endings</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">e en s es</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy6').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>The part that remains after removing the ending is referred to as the
<i>stem</i> of the word. If the stem consists of at least two letters, and
exists in the program-wide dictionary, then the resulting dictionary word will
have the stem as its essential part, and the ending as its optional part.
During comparison (unification with another bound value), only the essential
part is considered. During printing, both the essential part and the optional
part are printed.
</p>
<p>During <a href="builtins.html#trace">tracing</a>, dictionary words are displayed with a plus sign (+)
separating the essential and optional parts. Thus, if the German word
&ldquo;klein&rdquo; is part of the game-wide dictionary, and the player enters
<span class="prginput">KLEINES</span>, that word appears as <span class="tt">@klein+es</span> in the trace
logs, and unifies successfully with <span class="code">@klein</span>.
</p>
<p>If a word of input isn't recognized at all, even after considering the
removable word endings, then it's an <i>unrecognized</i> dictionary word. It
can still be stored in a variable, retrieved, and printed back, and it will
unify successfully with other instances of the same unrecognized word. When
tracing is enabled, unrecognized dictionary words are displayed with a plus
sign at the end.
</p>
<p>For instance, the input <span class="prginput">TAKE&nbsp;02&nbsp;UNKNOWNWORD,X&nbsp;BALL</span> may,
depending on the contents of the dictionary, be represented by the list:
<span class="nobreak"><span class="code">[take 2 unknownword , x ball]</span>.</span> As part of a trace,
it might be displayed as
<span class="nobreak"><span class="code">[take 2 unknownword+ , x ball]</span>.</span>
</p>
<p>Special gotcha: Recall that zero-prefixed numbers in the source code, as well
as numbers that are out of range, are treated as words. If <span class="code">007</span>
appears in the program in such a way that it becomes part of the program-wide
dictionary, then it will show up as a dictionary word in the list returned by
<span class="code">(get input&nbsp;$)</span>. Otherwise, it will be represented by the numerical
value&nbsp;7.
</p>
<h3>Splitting input by keywords</h3>
<p>During parsing, it is often necessary to scan a list for certain keywords, and
then split it into two sublists, representing the elements on either side of
the matched keyword. It is straightforward to implement this using ordinary
rules in Dialog. However, for performance reasons the language also provides a
built-in predicate:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy7" readonly>
(split $Input by $Keywords into $Left and $Right)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(split $Input by $Keywords into $Left and $Right)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy7').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p><span class="code">$Input</span> and <span class="code">$Keywords</span> must be lists of simple values,
i.e. they mustn't contain sublists.
</p>
<p>The <span class="code">$Input</span> list will be scanned, starting at its head, until the
first element that also appears in <span class="code">$Keywords</span> is found. A list of
the elements that came before the keyword is unified with <span class="code">$Left</span>,
and a list of the elements that follow it is unified with <span class="code">$Right</span>.
That is, neither <span class="code">$Left</span> nor <span class="code">$Right</span> includes the
keyword itself.
</p>
<p>When invoked as a multi-query, the predicate backtracks over each matching
position. Thus:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy8" readonly>
	*(split [the good , the bad and the ugly]
		by [and ,]
		into $Left and $Right)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">*(split [the good , the bad and the ugly]</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="tab"> </span>by [and ,]</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="tab"> </span>into $Left and $Right)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy8').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>will succeed twice: First, binding <span class="code">$Left</span> to <span class="code">[the
good]</span> and <span class="code">$Right</span> to <span class="code">[the bad and the ugly]</span>,
and then a second time binding <span class="code">$Left</span> to <span class="code">[the good , the
bad]</span> and <span class="code">$Right</span> to <span class="code">[the ugly]</span>.
</p>
<p>The split-by predicate can also be used to check whether a list contains one or
more of a set of keywords. The standard library uses it that way in the
following rule definition:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy9" readonly>
($X contains one of $Y)
	(split $X by $Y into $ and $)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">($X contains one of $Y)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(split $X by $Y into $ and $)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy9').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<h3>Determining objects from words</h3>
<p>This section is mainly of concern for library programmers, so story authors may
safely skip it.
</p>
<p>Dialog has a special construct for matching player input against in-world
object names in a very efficient way:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy10" readonly>
	(determine object $Obj)
		<i>object generator</i>
	(from words)
		<i>word generator</i>
	(matching all of $Input)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(determine object $Obj)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="tab"> </span><i>object generator</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(from words)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="tab"> </span><i>word generator</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(matching all of $Input)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy10').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>This statement will backtrack over every object <span class="code">$Obj</span> for which:<br />
</p>
<p class="indented">&bull; <i>object generator</i> succeeds, and<br />
&bull; <i>word generator</i>, when exhausted, emits at least every word in the <span class="code">$Input</span> list.
</p>
<p>The variable <span class="code">$Obj</span> should appear both in the object generator and
in the word generator, and the object generator should contain a multi-query to
backtrack over a set of objects. A canonical example is:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy11" readonly>
	(determine object $Obj)
		*($Obj is in scope)
	(from words)
		*(dict $Obj)
	(matching all of $Input)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(determine object $Obj)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="tab"> </span>*($Obj is in scope)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(from words)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="tab"> </span>*(dict $Obj)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(matching all of $Input)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy11').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>A non-optimizing compiler could deal with this construct as follows: First,
compile normal code for the object generator. Then, exhaust every branch of the
word generator, collecting all its output into a temporary list of words.
Finally, check that every word of <span class="code">$Input</span> appears in the temporary
list.
</p>
<p>However, the Dialog compiler and debugger both perform the following
optimization: At compile-time, they analyze the word generator statically, and
construct a reverse lookup table, mapping words of input to objects. At
runtime, this table is consulted first, based on <span class="code">$Input</span>, to
determine what objects the player might be referring to. So, for instance, if
the input is <span class="prginput">LARGE HAT</span>, and there are only two game objects for
which <span class="code">(dict $Obj)</span> can produce both of those words, then
<span class="code">$Obj</span> will now be bound to each of those two objects in turn. But
if there are dozens of large hats, <span class="code">$Obj</span> may instead be left
unbound; the compiler is allowed to make a trade-off between speed and memory
footprint. Either way, after this step, the operation proceeds as in the
unoptimized case.
</p>
<a id="trace"></a><h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>The following built-in predicates are useful for debugging:
</p>
<p class="codeline">(breakpoint)</p>
<p class="noteline">If the program is currently running inside the interactive debugger,
suspend execution and print the current source code filename and line
number. When execution resumes, this query succeeds.
</p>
<p class="noteline">If the program is running on the Z-machine, the query simply succeeds.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(trace on)</p>
<p class="noteline">Enables tracing. Following this, debugging information will be printed
when queries are made, and when rule bodies are entered. The
interactive debugger will also report when solutions are found, and
when dynamic predicates are updated.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(trace off)</p>
<p class="noteline">Disables tracing.
</p>
<p>If your program source code contains a query to <span class="code">(trace on)</span>
anywhere, the Z-machine backend will insert extra instructions all over the
generated code, to deal with tracing. This is known as <i>instrumenting</i> the
code, and it makes the program slower and larger. Thus, you'll only want to use
these predicates temporarily, during debugging. The compiler prints a warning
when it adds the extra instructions.
</p>
<p>Please be aware that the Dialog compiler and debugger do optimize your program,
and you will be tracing the optimized code, so certain queries and rules will
be missing from the debug printouts. You will generally want to do all your
tracing in the debugger, which mercifully turns off some of the more confusing
optimizations. That being said, tracing the optimized Z-code is highly useful
when trying to speed up a program.
</p>
<a id="system"></a><h2>System control</h2>
<p>The following built-in predicates offer low-level control over the interpreter
and the Dialog runtime. This is decidedly in the domain of library code, so
story authors rarely need to worry about these predicates.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(quit)</p>
<p class="noteline">Immediately terminates the program. This predicate neither fails nor
succeeds.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(restart)</p>
<p class="noteline">Resets the program to its initial state. The only part of the game
state that may survive a restart is the state of the output machinery
(including the current style and on-screen contents, and whether the
transcript feature is on or off). If the operation succeeds, execution
resumes from the start of the program. If there is an error, or the
interpreter doesn't support restarting, execution continues normally,
i.e. the query succeeds.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(save $ComingBack)</p>
<p class="noteline">Attempts to save the current game state to a file. The interpreter
takes care of asking the player for a filename. In the event of a save
error, or if the operation was cancelled, the query fails. On success,
the parameter is unified with&nbsp;0 if we just saved the state, and with&nbsp;1
if we just restored the state from a file saved by this query.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(restore)</p>
<p class="noteline">Attempts to restore the current game state from a file. The interpreter
takes care of asking the player for a filename. The only part of the
game state that may survive a restore is the state of the output
machinery (including the current style and on-screen contents, and
whether the transcript feature is on or off). If the operation
succeeds, execution resumes after the query from which the save file
was written. Otherwise, in the event of a load error or if the
operation was cancelled, execution continues normally, i.e. the query
succeeds.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(save undo $ComingBack)</p>
<p class="noteline">Works just like <span class="code">(save&nbsp;$)</span>, but stores the game state in a
buffer in memory. This operation is typically invoked once per move.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(undo)</p>
<p class="noteline">Works like <span class="code">(restore)</span>, but restores the game state from the
undo buffer. If there is no saved undo state, the predicate fails. If
there's some other problem&mdash;such as the interpreter imposing a limit
on the number of undo states that are retained in memory&mdash;the
predicate succeeds, and execution continues normally.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(interpreter supports undo)</p>
<p class="noteline">Succeeds if and only if the current interpreter declares that it
supports undo functionality.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(script on)</p>
<p class="noteline">Enables the transcript feature. The interpreter takes care of asking
the player for a filename. If the operation succeeds, the query suceeds.
In case of an error, or if the operation was cancelled, the query
fails.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(script off)</p>
<p class="noteline">Disables the transcript feature. This predicate always succeeds.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(display memory statistics)</p>
<p class="noteline">Prints a line of information specific to the compiler backend, about
the peak memory usage in the heap, auxiliary heap, and long-term heap
areas. Currently, only the Z-machine backend does this. The size of
these areas can be adjusted by passing commandline options to the
compiler. During debugging and testing, you may wish to invoke this
predicate just before quitting, as it will tell you how close you are
to the limits.

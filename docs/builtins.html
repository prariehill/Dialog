<a id="typechecks"></a><h2>Checking the type of a value</h2>
<p>Dialog contains a set of built-in predicates for checking if a value is of a
particular type. They are:
</p>
<p class="codeline">(unbound $X)</p>
<p class="noteline">Succeeds if and only if <span class="code">$X</span> is currently an unbound variable.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(number $X)</p>
<p class="noteline">Succeeds if and only if <span class="code">$X</span> is bound to a number.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(word $X)</p>
<p class="noteline">Succeeds if and only if <span class="code">$X</span> is bound to a dictionary word.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(empty $X)</p>
<p class="noteline">Succeeds if and only if <span class="code">$X</span> is bound to an empty list.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(non-empty $X)</p>
<p class="noteline">Succeeds if and only if <span class="code">$X</span> is bound to a non-empty list.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(list $X)</p>
<p class="noteline">Succeeds if and only if <span class="code">$X</span> is bound to a list (empty or non-empty).
</p>
<p>The last one comes with an extra feature:
</p>
<p class="codeline">(object $X)</p>
<p class="noteline">If <span class="code">$X</span> is bound to an object, the query succeeds. If it is
bound to anything else, the query fails. But if <span class="code">$X</span> is
unbound, <span class="code">*(object $X)</span> backtracks over every object in the
game.
</p>
<a id="arithmetic"></a><h2>Numbers and arithmetic</h2>
<p>The Dialog language is designed for symbolic manipulation, predicate logic, and
storytelling. Arithmetic is possible, but the syntax is rather clunky.
</p>
<p class="codeline">($A plus $B into $C)</p>
<p class="noteline"><span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> must be bound to numbers;
<span class="code">C</span> is unified with their sum. If the result is outside the
valid range of numbers, the query fails.
</p>
<p class="codeline">($A minus $B into $C)</p>
<p class="noteline"><span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> must be bound to numbers;
<span class="code">C</span> is unified with their difference.  If the result is
outside the valid range of numbers, the query fails.
</p>
<p class="codeline">($A times $B into $C)</p>
<p class="noteline"><span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> must be bound to numbers;
<span class="code">C</span> is unified with their product. If the product is outside
the valid range of numbers, the query succeeds, but the numeric result
is unpredictable (i.e. it depends on the interpreter).
</p>
<p class="codeline">($A divided by $B into $C)</p>
<p class="noteline"><span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> must be bound to numbers;
<span class="code">C</span> is unified with the (integer) quotient after dividing
<span class="code">A</span> by <span class="code">B</span>. The query fails if <span class="code">B</span> is
zero.
</p>
<p class="codeline">($A modulo $B into $C)</p>
<p class="noteline"><span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> must be bound to numbers;
<span class="code">C</span> is unified with the remainder after dividing
<span class="code">A</span> by <span class="code">B</span>. The query fails if <span class="code">B</span> is
zero.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(random from $A to $B into $C)</p>
<p class="noteline"><span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> must be bound to numbers, such that
<span class="code">B</span> is greater than or equal to <span class="code">A</span>. A random
number in the range <span class="code">A</span> to <span class="code">B</span> (inclusive) is
picked, and then unified with <span class="code">C</span>.
</p>
<p class="codeline">($A &lt; $B)</p>
<p class="noteline">This predicate succeeds if and only if <span class="code">A</span> is numerically
less than <span class="code">B</span>.
</p>
<p class="codeline">($A &gt; $B)</p>
<p class="noteline">This predicate succeeds if and only if <span class="code">A</span> is numerically
greater than <span class="code">B</span>.
</p>
<p>Common to all of the above predicates is that they fail if <span class="code">A</span> or
<span class="code">B</span> is unbound, or bound to a non-number. <span class="code">C</span> may be
bound or unbound; it is unified with the result of the computation.
</p>
<p>To check for numerical equality, use regular unification, i.e. <span class="code">($&nbsp;=
$)</span>.
</p>
<p>All numbers in Dialog are restricted to the range <span class="nobreak">0&ndash;16383</span>
(inclusive). This range directly supports four-digit numbers such as years and
PIN codes. Pocket money should be fairly straightforward to implement by
counting in cents; story authors (or library developers) that require more
sophisticated number crunching will have to get creative.
</p>
<a id="styles"></a><h2>Styles and formatting</h2>
<p>To change the current text style, use the built-in predicates
<span class="code">(bold)</span>, <span class="code">(italic)</span>, <span class="code">(reverse)</span>, and
<span class="code">(fixed pitch)</span> to enable each respective style, and
<span class="code">(roman)</span> to disable all four.
</p>
<p>The built-in predicate <span class="code">(uppercase)</span> forces the next character to be
printed in uppercase. The standard library uses this to define a number of
convenient predicates such as:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy0" readonly>
(The $Obj)	(uppercase) (the $Obj)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="left">(The $Obj)</td><td class="right">(uppercase) (the $Obj)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy0').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>To clear the screen below the status bar area, use <span class="code">(clear)</span>. To
clear the entire screen and disable the status bar, use <span class="code">(clear
all)</span>. Be aware that on some interpreters, clearing interferes with the
player's ability to scroll back and review earlier parts of the play session.
</p>
<p>The built-in predicate <span class="code">(space&nbsp;$)</span> prints a given number of space
characters in succession.
</p>
<p>Its vertical counterpart, <span class="code">(par&nbsp;$)</span>, produces a paragraph break with
a height corresponding to the given number of blank lines. Adjacent paragraph
breaks are merged based on the maximum specified height, so
<span class="code">(par&nbsp;5)&nbsp;(par&nbsp;7)</span> produces seven blank lines.
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy1" readonly>
(program entry point)
	(clear all)
	(par 10)
	(space 10)
	(bold)
	This text is printed in bold, starting at row 11, column 11.
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(program entry point)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(clear all)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(par 10)</td></tr>

<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(bold)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">This text is printed in bold, starting at row 11, column 11.</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy1').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<a id="input"></a><h2>Input</h2>
<p>User input is represented by dictionary words. The Dialog compiler collects all
dictionary words mentioned explicitly in the source code (with the
<span class="nobreak"><span class="code">@</span>-prefix</span> or as bare words inside lists), as well as
every literal word that can come out of a <span class="code">(collect words)</span>
expression. In addition, the system makes sure to provide a single-letter
dictionary word for every character supported by the underlying platform.
</p>
<p>On a side note, don't worry about the Z-machine game dictionary getting bloated
with every possible one-character word. It may appear so at the Dialog level,
but the underlying runtime representation is different.
</p>
<p>There are three built-in predicates for obtaining input from the player. One
waits for a single keypress, while the other two read a full line of input.
</p>
<h3>Get key</h3>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy2" readonly>
	(get key $Char)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(get key $Char)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy2').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>This predicate waits for the player to type a character.
</p>
<p>Some interpreters indicate that the game is waiting for input by displaying a
flashing cursor. Others don't, so story authors may wish to prompt the reader
explicitly.
</p>
<p>The parameter, <span class="code">$Char</span>, is unified with a dictionary word
representing the character that was typed, e.g. <span class="code">@e</span> if the
<span class="prginput">E</span> key was pressed. Note that dictionary words are
case-insensitive, so for letters of the alphabet there is no way to tell
whether the player was holding shift or not.
</p>
<p>Some special keys correspond to dictionary words that can't be represented
directly in Dialog source code. The dictionary words for these keys can be
obtained at runtime, by querying the following built-in predicates:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy3" readonly>
(word representing return $Char)
(word representing space $Char)
(word representing backspace $Char)
(word representing up $Char)
(word representing down $Char)
(word representing left $Char)
(word representing right $Char)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(word representing return $Char)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(word representing space $Char)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(word representing backspace $Char)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(word representing up $Char)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(word representing down $Char)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(word representing left $Char)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(word representing right $Char)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy3').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>A simple keypress dispatcher might look like this:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy4" readonly>
(program entry point)
	(get key $Key)
	(handle keypress $Key)

(handle keypress @a)
	'A' was pressed.

(handle keypress @b)
	'B' was pressed.

(handle keypress (word representing return $))
	RETURN was pressed.
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(program entry point)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(get key $Key)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(handle keypress $Key)</td></tr>

<tr><td class="blank" colspan="2"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(handle keypress (word representing return $))</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">RETURN was pressed.</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy4').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<h3>Get input</h3>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy5" readonly>
	(get input $WordList)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(get input $WordList)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy5').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>This query blocks execution until the player types a line of input, followed by
return. Different interpreters provide different levels of line-editing
facilities, ranging from simple backspace handling all the way up to input
history and spell checking.
</p>
<p>The parameter, <span class="code">$WordList</span>, is unified with a list where each
element represents a word typed by the player. The punctuation characters full
stop, comma, double quote, semicolon, and asterisk are treated as individual
words; the remaining text is separated into words by whitespace. If a word is
recognized as one that appears in the program-wide dictionary, then the element
will be that dictionary word. Else, if the word is a decimal number in the
range <span class="nobreak">0&ndash;16383</span>, the element will be that number.
</p>
<p>If the word was neither recognized, nor found to be a decimal number, then
Dialog will attempt to remove certain word endings, and check whether the
remaining part of the word exists in the dictionary. This procedure is
necessary for games written in e.g. German, whereas English games generally do
not require it.
</p>
<p>To specify removable endings, add one or more rule definitions to the predicate
<span class="code">(removable word endings)</span>. Each rule body should consist of one or
more word endings:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy6" readonly>
(removable word endings)
	%% German adjective endings
	en es em e

(removable word endings)
	%% German noun endings
	e en s es
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(removable word endings)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="comment">%% German adjective endings</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">en es em e</td></tr>
<tr><td class="blank" colspan="2"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(removable word endings)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="comment">%% German noun endings</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">e en s es</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy6').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>The part that remains after removing the ending is referred to as the
<i>stem</i> of the word. If the stem consists of at least two letters, and
exists in the program-wide dictionary, then that dictionary word is returned.
</p>
<p>If all else fails, the word of input will be represented by a list of
characters, each character itself a dictionary word.
</p>
<p>For instance, the input <span class="prginput">TAKE&nbsp;02&nbsp;UNKNOWNWORD,X&nbsp;BALL</span> may,
depending on the contents of the dictionary, be represented by the list:
<span class="nobreak"><span class="code">[take 2 [u n k n o w n w o r d] , x ball]</span></span>
</p>
<p>In practice, unknown words are ignored by most rules dealing with player input.
The reason for providing such words as lists of characters is to allow programs
to print them back, e.g. to complain that a particular word wasn't understood.
</p>
<p>Special gotcha: Recall that zero-prefixed numbers in the source code, as well
as numbers that are out of range, are treated as words. If <span class="code">007</span>
appears in the program in such a way that it becomes part of the program-wide
dictionary, then it will show up as a dictionary word in the list returned by
<span class="code">(get input)</span>. Otherwise, it will be represented by the numerical
value&nbsp;7.
</p>
<h3>Get raw input</h3>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy7" readonly>
	(get raw input $CharList)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(get raw input $CharList)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy7').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>This query reads a line of input just like <span class="code">(get input $)</span>, but does
not try to interpret it as a series of dictionary words or numbers.
</p>
<p>This is useful, for instance, for asking the player what their name is. It
makes sense to treat the player's name as an opaque list of characters, just in
case their first or last name is over nine letters long and happens to match a
dictionary word: Recall that long dictionary words are truncated&mdash;and we
generally do not want to truncate the player's name when we print it back.
</p>
<h3>Splitting input by keywords</h3>
<p>During parsing, it is often necessary to scan a list for certain keywords, and
then split it into two sublists, representing the elements on either side of
the matched keyword. It is straightforward to implement this using ordinary
rules in Dialog. However, for performance reasons the language also provides a
built-in predicate:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy8" readonly>
(split $Input by $Keywords into $Left and $Right)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(split $Input by $Keywords into $Left and $Right)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy8').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p><span class="code">$Keywords</span> must be a list of simple values (i.e. no unbound
variables or sublists).  The <span class="code">$Input</span> list will be scanned, starting
at its head, until the first element that also appears in
<span class="code">$Keywords</span> is found. A list of the elements that came before the
keyword is unified with <span class="code">$Left</span>, and a list of the elements that
follow it is unified with <span class="code">$Right</span>. That is, neither
<span class="code">$Left</span> nor <span class="code">$Right</span> includes the keyword itself.
</p>
<p>When invoked as a multi-query, the predicate backtracks over each matching
position. Thus:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy9" readonly>
	*(split [the good , the bad and the ugly]
		by [and ,]
		into $Left and $Right)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">*(split [the good , the bad and the ugly]</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="tab"> </span>by [and ,]</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="tab"> </span>into $Left and $Right)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy9').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>will succeed twice: First, binding <span class="code">$Left</span> to <span class="code">[the
good]</span> and <span class="code">$Right</span> to <span class="code">[the bad and the ugly]</span>,
and then a second time binding <span class="code">$Left</span> to <span class="code">[the good , the
bad]</span> and <span class="code">$Right</span> to <span class="code">[the ugly]</span>.
</p>
<p>The split-by predicate can also be used to check whether a list contains one or
more of a set of keywords. The standard library uses it that way in the
following rule definition:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy10" readonly>
($X contains one of $Y)
	(split $X by $Y into $ and $)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">($X contains one of $Y)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(split $X by $Y into $ and $)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy10').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<a id="trace"></a><h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>The following built-in predicates are useful for debugging:
</p>
<p class="codeline">(breakpoint)</p>
<p class="noteline">If the program is currently running inside the interactive debugger,
suspend execution and print the current source code filename and line
number. When execution resumes, this query succeeds.
</p>
<p class="noteline">If the program is running on the Z-machine, the query simply succeeds.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(trace on)</p>
<p class="noteline">Enables tracing. Following this, debugging information will be printed
when queries are made, and when rule bodies are entered. The
interactive debugger will also report when solutions are found, and
when dynamic predicates are updated.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(trace off)</p>
<p class="noteline">Disables tracing.
</p>
<p>If your program source code contains a query to <span class="code">(trace on)</span>
anywhere, the Z-machine backend will insert extra instructions all over the
generated code, to deal with tracing. This is known as <i>instrumenting</i> the
code, and it makes the program slower and larger. Thus, you'll only want to use
these predicates temporarily, during debugging. The compiler prints a warning
when it adds the extra instructions.
</p>
<p>Please be aware that the Dialog compiler and debugger do optimize your program,
and you will be tracing the optimized code, so certain queries and rules will
be missing from the debug printouts. You will generally want to do all your
tracing in the debugger, which mercifully turns off some of the more confusing
optimizations. That being said, tracing the optimized Z-code is highly useful
when trying to speed up a program.
</p>
<a id="system"></a><h2>System control</h2>
<p>The following built-in predicates offer low-level control over the interpreter
and the Dialog runtime. This is decidedly in the domain of library code, so
story authors rarely need to worry about these predicates.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(quit)</p>
<p class="noteline">Immediately terminates the program. This predicate neither fails nor
succeeds.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(restart)</p>
<p class="noteline">Resets the program to its initial state. The only part of the game
state that may survive a restart is the state of the output machinery
(including the current style and on-screen contents, and whether the
transcript feature is on or off). If the operation succeeds, execution
resumes from the start of the program. If there is an error, or the
interpreter doesn't support restarting, execution continues normally,
i.e. the query succeeds.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(save $ComingBack)</p>
<p class="noteline">Attempts to save the current game state to a file. The interpreter
takes care of asking the player for a filename. In the event of a save
error, or if the operation was cancelled, the query fails. On success,
the parameter is unified with&nbsp;0 if we just saved the state, and with&nbsp;1
if we just restored the state from a file saved by this query.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(restore)</p>
<p class="noteline">Attempts to restore the current game state from a file. The interpreter
takes care of asking the player for a filename. The only part of the
game state that may survive a restore is the state of the output
machinery (including the current style and on-screen contents, and
whether the transcript feature is on or off). If the operation
succeeds, execution resumes after the query from which the save file
was written. Otherwise, in the event of a load error or if the
operation was cancelled, execution continues normally, i.e. the query
succeeds.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(save undo $ComingBack)</p>
<p class="noteline">Works just like <span class="code">(save&nbsp;$)</span>, but stores the game state in a
buffer in memory. This operation is typically invoked once per move.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(undo)</p>
<p class="noteline">Works like <span class="code">(restore)</span>, but restores the game state from the
undo buffer. If there is no saved undo state, the predicate fails. If
there's some other problem&mdash;such as the interpreter imposing a limit
on the number of undo states that are retained in memory&mdash;the
predicate succeeds, and execution continues normally.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(interpreter supports undo)</p>
<p class="noteline">Succeeds if and only if the current interpreter declares that it
supports undo functionality.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(script on)</p>
<p class="noteline">Enables the transcript feature. The interpreter takes care of asking
the player for a filename. If the operation succeeds, the query suceeds.
In case of an error, or if the operation was cancelled, the query
fails.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(script off)</p>
<p class="noteline">Disables the transcript feature. This predicate always succeeds.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(display memory statistics)</p>
<p class="noteline">Prints a line of information specific to the compiler backend, about
the peak memory usage in the heap and auxiliary heap areas. Currently,
only the Z-machine backend does this. The size of these areas can be
adjusted by passing commandline options to the compiler. During
debugging and testing, you may wish to invoke this predicate just
before quitting, as it will tell you how close you are to the limits.

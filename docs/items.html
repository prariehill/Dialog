<a id="pristine"></a><h2>Pristine and handled objects</h2>
<p>As a general rule, the standard library doesn't call attention to game objects.
The story author is expected to mention them as part of the description of
their parent object (such as the room).
</p>
<p>But there is an important exception: As soon as the player picks up an object
(or otherwise moves it from its original location), the responsibility for
mentioning that object is transferred to the library. We say that the object
has become <i>handled</i> or, equivalently, that it is no longer <i>pristine</i>.
</p>
<p>There's a compelling pragmatic reason for this: When players are able to move
objects around, those objects will eventually end up in strange locations,
unanticipated by the story author. Players will put the flower pot on top of
the bed, or take off their clothes and put them inside the ashtray, and the
story author cannot be expected to provide custom text for every combination
the player can think of. So, once objects start moving around, the library
takes over the initiative in calling attention to them, using bland, default
messages. They story author may then choose to override those messages on a
case-by-case basis, and we will soon see how that's done in practice.
</p>
<p>For now, the important thing to remember is that items (and wearable objects)
can move around, and therefore we should only call them out in room
descriptions (and in the descriptions of containers and supporters) when they
are in their pristine state. Whenever we include a movable object in our story,
we have a responsibility to check this. It can be done with an if-statement as
in the following example:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy1" readonly>
#bowl
(name *)		small bowl
(descr *)		It's a small bowl.
(item *)
(* is #on #table)

(descr #table)

	(if) (#bowl is pristine) (then)
		A small bowl is placed exactly in its centre.

<p>Non-movable objects will remain pristine forever, so they can be described
without a check.
</p>
<p>Here is a complete example game with movable objects:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy2" readonly>

<p>Try it! You might want to <span class="prginput">LOOK</span>, <span class="prginput">X TABLE</span>,
<span class="prginput">LOOK IN BOWL</span>, <span class="prginput">GET ALL</span>, <span class="prginput">PUT STONE IN

</p>
<a id="synonyms"></a><h2>Plural forms</h2>
<p><span class="code">(dict&nbsp;$)</span> and <span class="code">(plural dict&nbsp;$)</span> can be used to add
synonyms to objects. In the example above, we added both singular and plural
synonyms to all objects belonging to the <span class="code">(stone&nbsp;$)</span> category. A
command such as <span class="prginput">GET STONES</span> will result in every stone being
picked up, due to the plural form. In contrast, <span class="prginput">GET STONE</span>
triggers a disambiguating question, where the game asks the player whether they
meant to pick up the amethyst or the sapphire.
</p>
<a id="appearance"></a><h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>You may have noticed a problem with the last example: When the player examines
the bowl, there is no mention of the stones within. For an oldschool game, it
may be acceptable to expect the player to <span class="prginput">SEARCH</span> or <span class="prginput">LOOK
IN</span> the bowl in order to find them. But for modern, narrative-driven
games, that approach is generally frowned upon. We could mention the stones in
the description of the bowl. But there are two stones, so how do we do that? Do
we check whether they are both pristine? I.e.:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy3" readonly>
(descr #bowl)
	It's a small bowl.
	(if)
		(#sapphire is pristine)
		(#amethyst is pristine)
	(then)
		There are two precious stones in it.
	(endif)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(descr #bowl)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">It's a small bowl.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(if)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="tab"> </span>(#sapphire is pristine)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="tab"> </span>(#amethyst is pristine)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(then)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="tab"> </span>There are two precious stones in it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(endif)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy3').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>But what if the player only picks up the amethyst, and then puts it back? The
sapphire is still in the bowl, but the story doesn't mention it, and the
library only prints a stock message about the amethyst (because it is no longer
pristine). Another option is to add lots of special cases:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy4" readonly>
(descr #bowl)
	It's a small bowl.
	(if)
		(#sapphire is pristine)
		(#amethyst is pristine)
	(then)
		There are two precious stones in it.
	(elseif)
		*($Stone is one of [#sapphire #amethyst])
		($Stone is pristine)
	(then)
		There's (a $Stone) in it.
	(endif)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(descr #bowl)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">It's a small bowl.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(if)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="tab"> </span>(#sapphire is pristine)</td></tr>

</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy4').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>But this doesn't scale well, if there were more than two precious stones in the
bowl to begin with. We also have the option to cop out entirely, and tell the
library to narrate these objects already from the start:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy5" readonly>
(descr #bowl)
	It's a small bowl.

(#sapphire is handled)
(#amethyst is handled)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(descr #bowl)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">It's a small bowl.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="blank" colspan="2"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(#sapphire is handled)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(#amethyst is handled)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy5').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>Remember, handled is the opposite of pristine in this context. Now, when the
player first examines the bowl, the game responds:
</p>
<div class="blkoutput">It's a small bowl.<br />
<br />
An amethyst is in the small bowl.<br />
<br />
A sapphire is in the small bowl.</div><p>But that's decidedly clunky. A somewhat better approach, although still a
cop-out, is to print a vague message that encourages the player to look inside
the bowl, without mentioning any details about what's inside:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy6" readonly>
(descr #bowl)
	It's a small bowl.
	(if) ($ is #in #bowl) (then)
		There appears to be something inside.
	(endif)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(descr #bowl)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">It's a small bowl.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(if) ($ is #in #bowl) (then)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="tab"> </span>There appears to be something inside.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(endif)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy6').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>But this will backfire, in a sense, if the player takes the amethyst and then
puts it back. Examining the bowl would then result in the following output:
</p>
<div class="blkoutput">It's a small bowl. There appears to be something inside.<br />
<br />
An amethyst is in the small bowl.</div><p>Here, the library called attention to the amethyst (handled), but not to the
sapphire (pristine). The printed text is technically correct, but while the
first paragraph encourages the player to look inside the bowl, the second
paragraph takes that incentive away, and the player is mislead to believe that
there's nothing in the bowl apart from the amethyst.
</p>
<p>Instead, the recommended way to handle this situation is to selectively
override the <i>appearance text</i> that's printed for handled objects by the
library. The message &ldquo;<span class="prgoutput">An amethyst is in the small bowl</span>&rdquo;
originates from a predicate called <span class="code">(appearance $Object $Relation
$Parent)</span>. The first step is to tell the library to refrain from printing
such a message about any object that's currently in the bowl:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy7" readonly>
(appearance $ #in #bowl)
	%% Objects in the bowl have a blank appearance.
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(appearance $ #in #bowl)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="comment">%% Objects in the bowl have a blank appearance.</span></td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy7').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>Now that we have silenced those particular messages from the standard library,
we must provide our own variant in the description of the bowl. But we have to
be careful: With the rule above, we turned off automatic descriptions for any
object in the bowl, not just the amethyst and the sapphire. So we have to take
care of any foreign objects that might end up there too. In some situations, it
might be sufficient to drop a vague hint:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy8" readonly>
(descr #bowl)
	It's a small bowl.
	(if) ($ is #in #bowl) (then)
		There appears to be something inside.
	(endif)

(appearance $ #in #bowl)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(descr #bowl)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">It's a small bowl.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(if) ($ is #in #bowl) (then)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="tab"> </span>There appears to be something inside.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(endif)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="blank" colspan="2"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(appearance $ #in #bowl)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy8').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>A more advanced technique is to use a <a href="choicepoints.html#multiqueries">multi-query</a> and a
<a href="choicepoints.html#collect">collect statement</a> to print a list of all objects currently inside
the bowl:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy9" readonly>
(descr #bowl)
	It's a small bowl.
	(collect $Obj)
		*($Obj is #in #bowl)
	(into $List)
	You can see (a $List) in it.

(appearance $ #in #bowl)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(descr #bowl)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">It's a small bowl.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(collect $Obj)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="tab"> </span>*($Obj is #in #bowl)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(into $List)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">You can see (a $List) in it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="blank" colspan="2"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(appearance $ #in #bowl)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy9').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>An entirely different approach is to allow objects to call attention to
themselves, but to replace the stock message with a custom one. This is done by
overriding <span class="code">(appearence $ $&nbsp;$)</span> with a rule that prints text:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy10" readonly>
#sapphire
(appearance * $ $)
	(* is handled)
	A gleaming sapphire catches your eye.
	(notice *)	%% Bind &ldquo;it&rdquo;
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">#sapphire</td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(appearance * $ $)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(* is handled)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">A gleaming sapphire catches your eye.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(notice *)	<span class="comment">&emsp;%% Bind &ldquo;it&rdquo;</span></td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy10').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>That rule did not check the location of the sapphire, so it would override the
default message also when the sapphire makes an appearance as part of a room
description, or in any other place. Without the line <span class="code">(*&nbsp;is
handled)</span>, the message would also be printed while the object
is still pristine.
</p>
<p>To summarize, movable items are more complicated than other objects, because
there is a transfer of responsibility for calling attention to them. At first,
while they are pristine, the story author should mention them as a natural part
of the prose describing nearby objects (e.g. the room). As soon as they are
handled, the library takes over, unless the story author explicitly reclaims
control over their appearance.

<p>Dialog is heavily inspired by <i>Prolog</i>. Unless you've programmed in Prolog
before, you may find the material in the first three or so chapters to be
increasingly counter-intuitive, odd, or even downright crazy. But don't worry,
we'll take it in small steps, and hopefully the concepts will click together in
the end. If at any point you feel that the discussion is too abstract, don't
hesitate to head over to <a href="libintro.html">Part&nbsp;II</a> for a while, and then come
back.
</p>
<p>If you already know Prolog, you're still going to have to pay attention to the
details, as there are both obvious and subtle differences between the two
languages.
</p>
<a id="predsrules"></a><h2>Predicates and rules</h2>
<p>This is what &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; looks like in Dialog:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy0" readonly>
(program entry point)
	Hello, world!
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(program entry point)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">Hello, world!</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy0').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>A Dialog program is a list of <i>rule definitions</i>. A rule definition always
begins at the very first column of a line, but it may span several lines.
Subsequent lines of code that belong to the same rule have to be indented by at
least one space or tab character.
</p>
<p>There can be multiple rules with the same name. If so, they are said to belong
to the same <i>predicate</i>. The program above contains one predicate, built
from a single rule definition. The head of the rule is <span class="code">(program entry
point)</span>, and this is also the name of the predicate. The body of the rule
is some text to be printed verbatim, in this case &ldquo;Hello, world!&rdquo; Program
execution always begins with the predicate called <span class="code">(program entry
point)</span>. Sometimes we will refer to this as the top-level predicate.
</p>
<p>A predicate may call upon another predicate, similar to subroutine calls in
other programming languages. This is referred to as making a <i>query</i>. The
following program produces exactly the same output as the previous one:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy1" readonly>
(program entry point)
	Hello (my own rule)!

(my own rule)
	, world
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(program entry point)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">Hello (my own rule)!</td></tr>
<tr><td class="blank" colspan="2"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(my own rule)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">, world</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy1').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>The parentheses indicate that a query is to be made. When a query is made to a
predicate, all rules defined for that predicate are consulted in program order,
until one of them <i>succeeds</i>; we will return to the concept of success at
the end of the present chapter. If the program comprises several source code
files, the order of the rules is determined by the order in which the filenames
appeared on the command line.
</p>
<p>Predicate names are case-sensitive.
</p>
<a id="printing"></a><h2>Printing text</h2>
<p>Rule bodies contain statements to be executed. Plain text in a rule body is an
instruction to print that text. Some special characters (<span class="code">#</span>,
<span class="code">$</span>, <span class="code">@</span>, <span class="code">~</span>, <span class="code">*</span>, <span class="code">|</span>,
<span class="code">\</span>, parentheses, brackets, and braces) need to be prefixed by a
backslash (<span class="code">\</span>). No special treatment is required for apostrophes or
double quotes.
</p>
<p>Comments in the source code are prefixed with <span class="code">%%</span> and last to the
end of the line.
</p>
<p>Thus:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy2" readonly>
(program entry point)
	Hello y'all \( and "welcome" \) ! %% This is a comment.
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(program entry point)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">Hello y'all \( and "welcome" \) ! <span class="comment">&emsp;%% This is a comment.</span></td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy2').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>produces the output:
</p>
<div class="blkoutput">Hello y'all (and "welcome")!</div><p>Dialog is smart about punctuation and whitespace: It interprets the source code
text as a stream of words and punctuation characters, and rebuilds the output
from that stream, inserting whitespace as appropriate. It knows that no space
should precede a comma, that a space should go before an opening parenthesis
but not after it, and so on.
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy3" readonly>
(program entry point)
	For instance
	:This
		text


	\( which,to all intents&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and purposes,is silly\( indeed
	\) \)
	, prints properly.

<div class="blkoutput">Together , apart.</div><p>Line breaks are inserted with the <span class="code">(line)</span> built-in predicate;
paragraph breaks with <span class="code">(par)</span>. On the Z-machine, a paragraph break
is implemented as a blank line of output.
</p>
<p>Several adjacent line breaks are merged into one, preventing accidental
paragraph breaks. Likewise, several adjacent paragraph breaks are merged into
one, along with any adjacent line breaks, preventing accidental runs of more
than one blank line.

This goes on a line of its own.</div><a id="parameters"></a><h2>Parameters, objects, and wildcards</h2>
<p>Predicates can have <i>parameters</i>. The name of a predicate, called its
<i>signature</i>, is written with dollar signs as placeholders for the
parameters. These may appear anywhere in the predicate name. For instance,
<span class="code">(descr&nbsp;$)</span> is the signature of a predicate with one parameter, and
in this case the parameter is at the end.
</p>
<p>In rule heads and queries, <i>values</i> may appear in place of these dollar
signs. A common kind of value is the <i>object</i>. Objects in Dialog are
short, programmer-friendly names that start with a <span class="code">#</span>&nbsp;character and
refer to entities in the game world.
</p>
<p>Consider the following three rule definitions for the <span class="code">(descr&nbsp;$)</span>
predicate:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy6" readonly>
(descr #apple)	The apple looks yummy.
(descr #door)	The oaken door is oaken.
(descr $)	It looks pretty harmless.
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="left">(descr #apple)</td><td class="right">The apple looks yummy.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">(descr #door)</td><td class="right">The oaken door is oaken.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">(descr $)</td><td class="right">It looks pretty harmless.</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy6').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>When a value appears inside a rule head, the given parameter must have that
particular value in order for the rule to succeed. It is also possible to use
dollar signs as wildcards in rule heads.
</p>
<p>Let's take a look at how the three rule definitions above might be used in a
program. To print the description of an object, let's say the #door, one would
make the query <span class="code">(descr #door)</span>. Dialog would consider each of the
three rule definitions in program order. The first rule head doesn't match the
query, but the second does. Thus, the text &ldquo;<span class="prgoutput">The oaken door is
oaken.</span>&rdquo; is printed. The query <span class="code">(descr #orange)</span> would cause
the text &ldquo;<span class="prgoutput">It looks pretty harmless.</span>&rdquo; to be printed.
</p>
<p>Note that the general rule, the one with the wildcard, appears last. This is
crucial: If the general rule were to appear before e.g. the <span class="code">#door</span>
rule in the source code, it would supersede that rule every time, and the door
would be described as harmless.
</p>
<p>Signatures (predicate names) do not appear explicitly anywhere in the source
code. They are implied by rule heads and queries, where parameter values are
typically used instead of dollar signs.
</p>
<h3>Objects are thin</h3>
<p>Dialog objects are <i>thin</i>, in the sense that each hashtag is a mere
identifier, without any inherent behaviour or properties. This is in contrast
with object-oriented programming languages, where code and data are organized
inside objects and classes. In Dialog, the world is modelled using predicates
that specify relations between objects, but the objects themselves are just
names.
</p>
<p>Object names may contain alphanumeric characters (including a limited range of
international glyphs), dashes (<span class="code">-</span>), and underscores
(<span class="code">_</span>). They are case sensitive.
</p>
<a id="successfailure"></a><h2>Success and failure</h2>
<p>If a query is made to a predicate, but there is no matching rule in the
program, the query <i>fails</i>. When a rule makes a query, and that query
fails, the rule also fails and is immediately abandoned. In this way, the
failure condition might propagate to the calling rule, to its calling rule in
turn, and so on, all the way to the top-level predicate. Here is a simple
program that fails:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy7" readonly>
(program entry point)
	You see an orange. (descr #orange) Now what do you do?

(descr #apple)	The apple looks yummy.
(descr #door)	The oaken door is oaken.
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(program entry point)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">You see an orange. (descr #orange) Now what do you do?</td></tr>
<tr><td class="blank" colspan="2"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">(descr #apple)</td><td class="right">The apple looks yummy.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">(descr #door)</td><td class="right">The oaken door is oaken.</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy7').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>This program will print &ldquo;<span class="prgoutput">You see an orange</span>&rdquo;. Then, because there
is neither a rule for <span class="code">(descr #orange)</span> nor a rule for <span class="code">(descr
$)</span>, the query <span class="code">(descr #orange)</span> fails. This causes the top
rule, i.e. the program entry point, to fail, at which point the entire program
terminates. Hence, &ldquo;<span class="prgoutput">Now what do you do?</span>&rdquo; is never printed.
</p>
<p>If failure would always propagate all the way to the top and terminate the
program, it would be of little use. So of course, there's more to the story:
Recall that a query to a predicate causes each of its rule definitions to be
tried, in source code order, until a match is found. What happens when a rule
fails, is that this search continues where it left off. Consider the following
example:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy8" readonly>
(program entry point)
	(descr #apple)
	Over and out.

(descr #apple)
	(the player dislikes #apple)
	Yuck!

(descr $)
	It looks yummy!

(the player dislikes #orange)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(program entry point)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(descr #apple)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">Over and out.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="blank" colspan="2"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(descr #apple)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(the player dislikes #apple)</td></tr>

<tr><td class="blank" colspan="2"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(descr $)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">It looks yummy!</td></tr>
<tr><td class="blank" colspan="2"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(the player dislikes #orange)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy8').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>A query is made: <span class="code">(descr #apple)</span>. There's a matching rule, and this
rule makes a query in turn, to the predicate <span class="code">(the player
dislikes&nbsp;$)</span>, with the parameter <span class="code">#apple</span>. But this time,
there is no matching rule definition, so the query fails. This aborts the
execution of the <span class="code">(descr #apple)</span> rule, and the quest to satisfy the
original query, <span class="code">(descr #apple)</span>, resumes. And indeed there's
another match: <span class="code">(descr&nbsp;$)</span> prints &ldquo;<span class="prgoutput">It looks yummy!</span>&rdquo;
and succeeds. Thus, the program entry point rule will proceed to print
&ldquo;<span class="prgoutput">Over and out</span>&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>The complete output is:

<a id="actionsintro"></a><h2>Introduction to actions</h2>
<p><i>Actions</i> are data structures that represent the player's intentions. They
are constructed by a part of the Dialog standard library called the
<i>parser</i>, in response to commands typed by the player. Once an action has
been constructed by the parser, it is passed on to other parts of the program
to be processed. Actions have much in common with events in other programming
languages.
</p>
<p>In Dialog, actions are represented by lists of dictionary words and objects.
Here is an example of an action:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy0" readonly>
	[give #apple to #eve]
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">[give #apple to #eve]</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy0').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>Actions are thus a kind of stylized player input. The parser might construct
the above action if the player types <span class="prginput">GIVE APPLE TO EVE</span>,
<span class="prginput">GIVE RED FRUIT TO HER</span>, or even <span class="prginput">OFFER THE LADY
EVERYTHING</span>, depending on circumstances.
</p>
<p>Verbs and prepositions are represented by dictionary words in the action. For
nearly all of the standard actions, there is at least one form of recognized
player input that uses the same words in the same order.
</p>
<p>There is a subtlety here: Actions are lists of dictionary words and objects,
but raw player input, as returned by <a href="builtins.html#input">(get input&nbsp;$)</a>, is also
represented by a list of dictionary words. Thus, the parser might encounter the
raw player input <span class="code">[inventory]</span>, and convert it to the action
<span class="code">[inventory]</span>, which happens to be the exact same Dialog value. But
the player input could equally well have been <span class="code">[i]</span> or <span class="code">[take
inventory]</span>, and the resulting action would still be
<span class="code">[inventory]</span>.
</p>
<p>In <a href="understanding.html">Chapter&nbsp;9</a>, we will see how the parser produces
actions in response to player input. For now, we will take the output of that
process, i.e. the action data structures, as our starting point.
</p>
<h3>Intercepting actions</h3>
<p>To get started, let's consider one of the standard actions:
<span class="code">[open&nbsp;$]</span>. By default, this action will fail for objects that are
out of reach, non-openable, locked, or already open. Let's add a new rule to
<span class="code">prevent</span> opening a particular box while its owner is in the same
room as the player:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy1" readonly>
#box
(name *)	box
(openable *)

(prevent [open *])
	(current room $Room)		%% Get the current room.
	(#pandora is in room $Room)	%% Check if Pandora is here with us.
	You don't dare do that while Pandora is watching.
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">#box</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">(name *)</td><td class="right">box</td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(openable *)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="blank" colspan="2"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(prevent [open *])</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(current room $Room)		<span class="comment">&emsp;%% Get the current room.</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(#pandora is in room $Room)	<span class="comment">&emsp;%% Check if Pandora is here with us.</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">You don't dare do that while Pandora is watching.</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy1').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>But suppose Pandora isn't here, and the box is within reach, closed, and
unlocked. Now the open action will go through, and as a result, <span class="code">(#box is
open)</span> is set, and a stock message is printed: &ldquo;<span class="prgoutput">You open the
box.</span>&rdquo;
</p>
<p>We can change this stock message in one of two ways. The first and most
generally applicable technique is to define a <span class="code">perform</span> rule,
overriding the default behaviour of the action:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy2" readonly>
(perform [open #box])
	Shooting guilty glances in every direction, you carefully approach
	the box, peek under its lid, and slam it down again. The box was empty.
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(perform [open #box])</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">Shooting guilty glances in every direction, you carefully approach</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">the box, peek under its lid, and slam it down again. The box was empty.</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy2').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>But this also overrides the default side-effect of setting the <span class="code">($&nbsp;is
open)</span> flag of the object, so with the above code, the box remains closed
after the action has been carried out. The second technique allows us to
override only the printed message, while retaining the side-effects. All
predefined actions with side-effects (there are eighteen of them, and they are
known as the <i>core actions</i>) call out to their own individual <i>narration
predicates</i> that we can override:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy3" readonly>
(narrate opening #box)
	Shooting guilty glances in every direction, you carefully approach
	the box, and lift its lid. It seems to be empty.
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(narrate opening #box)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">Shooting guilty glances in every direction, you carefully approach</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">the box, and lift its lid. It seems to be empty.</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy3').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>Now, let's consider going between rooms. As we learned in the chapter on
<a href="moving.html">moving around</a>, the predicate <span class="code">(from $ go $ to&nbsp;$)</span>
defines obvious exits. This predicate is consulted by the default rules for
movement-related actions, but we can override those rules in order to implement
non-obvious exits, to block obvious exits, or to trigger cutscenes. In most
situations, the action we want to intercept is <span class="code">[leave $Room $Dir]</span>:
the action for leaving a room in a given direction.
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy4" readonly>
#shed
(room *)
(your *)
(name *)	shed
(look *)	You are in your shed. The exit is east.

(from * go #east to #outdoors)
(from * go #out to #east)

(prevent [leave * #east])
	But the world is such a wicked place.

#chair
(name *)	wooden chair
(on-seat *)
(* is #in #shed)

(instead of [leave #shed #up])
	(try [climb *])
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">#shed</td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(room *)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(your *)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">(name *)</td><td class="right">shed</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">(look *)</td><td class="right">You are in your shed. The exit is east.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="blank" colspan="2"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(from * go #east to #outdoors)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(from * go #out to #east)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="blank" colspan="2"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(prevent [leave * #east])</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">But the world is such a wicked place.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="blank" colspan="2"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">#chair</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">(name *)</td><td class="right">wooden chair</td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(on-seat *)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(* is #in #shed)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="blank" colspan="2"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(instead of [leave #shed #up])</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(try [climb *])</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy4').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>In that example, the only obvious exit is to the east, but it doesn't work.
Going up, on the other hand, is reinterpreted as a different action:
<span class="code">[climb #chair]</span>.
</p>
<p>Now that we've seen how to override the default behaviour of some of the
standard actions, it's time to look under the hood and see the actual machinery
that makes this work.
</p>
<a id="actionprocess"></a><h2>How actions are processed</h2>
<p>Once the parser has understood a command typed by the player, and encoded it as
a series of actions, each action is tried in turn. Trying an action involves
several predicates, as illustrated by the following chart:
</p>
<div class="img"><img src="actionprocessing.png" /></div>
<p>Everything starts with <span class="code">(try&nbsp;$)</span>, which is a predicate provided by
the standard library. The parameter is an action, and <span class="code">try</span> makes
queries to <span class="code">(refuse $)</span>, <span class="code">*(before $)</span>, and <span class="code">(instead
of $)</span>, passing the action along as a parameter. Briefly, the purpose of
<span class="code">refuse</span> is to ensure that every object mentioned in the action is
within reach of the player character, and the purpose of <span class="code">before</span> is
to automatically carry out certain mundane actions for the player, such as
opening doors before going through them. Refuse is invoked twice, just to make
sure that <span class="code">before</span> didn't mess things up.
</p>
<p><span class="code">(instead of&nbsp;$)</span> is responsible for looking at an action in detail,
determining whether its particular prerequisites are met, and actually carrying
it out. The default implementation of <span class="code">instead of</span> delegates these
responsibilities to <span class="code">(prevent&nbsp;$)</span> and <span class="code">(perform&nbsp;$)</span>,
again queried with the action as parameter. Finally, many of the standard
<span class="code">(perform&nbsp;$)</span> rules make queries to action-specific predicates such
as <span class="code">(descr&nbsp;$)</span>. But at this point, the parameters are usually
objects.
</p>
<p>Together, <span class="code">refuse</span>, <span class="code">before</span>, <span class="code">instead of</span>,
<span class="code">prevent</span>, and <span class="code">perform</span> are known as the five
<i>action-handling predicates</i>. Stories typically define rules for them in
order to extend, adjust, or override the default behaviour of the standard
library. Each action-handling predicate can be intercepted to serve a variety
of purposes. Before we dive into that, however, it is necessary to introduce
two important mechanisms: <i>Stopping the action</i>, and <i>ticking</i>
(advancing time).
</p>
<a id="tickstop"></a><h2>Stopping and ticking</h2>
<h3>(stop)</h3>
<p>The parser may generate several actions in response to a single line of player
input. These are tried in turn inside a <a href="control.html#stoppable">stoppable environment</a>,
and therefore every action-handling rule has the power to stop subsequent
actions using the <span class="code">(stop)</span> built-in predicate. It is generally a
good idea to invoke <span class="code">(stop)</span> when we have reason to believe that the
player has been surprised: When actions fail, or when dramatic cutscenes have
played out.
</p>
<h3>(tick)</h3>
<p>After an action has been tried, the standard library will generally advance
time in the game world, by querying a predicate called <span class="code">(tick)</span>. The
default implementation of <span class="code">(tick)</span> makes
<a href="choicepoints.html#multiqueries">multi-queries</a> to the story-supplied predicates <span class="code">(on
every tick)</span> and <span class="code">(on every tick in $Room)</span>. These can be used
to print flavour text, move non-player characters, implement daemons and timers
of various kinds, or anything else the story author might think of.
</p>
<p>Time is not advanced after <i>commands</i>, i.e. actions such as
<span class="code">[save]</span> and <span class="code">[transcript off]</span> that take place outside
the game world.
</p>
<h3>(tick) (stop)</h3>
<p>When an action-handling predicate decides to <span class="code">(stop)</span> everything,
this also prevents the usual ticking from being carried out. Therefore, a
common design pattern in action handlers is
<span class="nobreak"><span class="code">(tick)&nbsp;(stop)</span></span>, which causes time to pass as a result
of the present action, but stops any subsequent actions.
</p>
<a id="preventperform"></a><h2>Instead of, prevent, and perform</h2>
<p>Now we return to the five action-handling predicates. We will not consider them
in chronological order; instead we will start with <span class="code">instead&nbsp;of</span>,
<span class="code">prevent</span>, and <span class="code">perform</span>, as these are of most interest
to story authors.
</p>
<p>Let us begin by looking at the catch-all rule definition for <span class="code">(instead
of&nbsp;$)</span>, as implemented in the standard library. There are more specific
rule definitions preceding it in the library, but this is the base case:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy5" readonly>
(instead of $Action)
	~{ (prevent $Action) (tick) (stop) }
	(perform $Action)
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(instead of $Action)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">~{ (prevent $Action) (tick) (stop) }</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(perform $Action)</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy5').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>We see that if prevent succeeds, the action fails (after advancing time). Thus,
a story author can easily prevent a particular action from succeeding:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy6" readonly>
(prevent [eat #apple])
	You're not hungry.
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(prevent [eat #apple])</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">You're not hungry.</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy6').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>Since the story file appears before the standard library in source-code order,
its rules take precedence: There could be other prevent-rules in the library,
but they will have no influence on eating the apple.
</p>
<p>Here's a variant where the rule is conditioned by a global flag:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy7" readonly>
(prevent [eat #apple])
	~(the player is hungry)
	You're not hungry.
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(prevent [eat #apple])</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">~(the player is hungry)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">You're not hungry.</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy7').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>If no prevent-rule succeeds, control is passed to the <span class="code">(perform&nbsp;$)</span>
predicate. This is where the action is carried out, as per the following
example:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy8" readonly>
(perform [read #welcomesign])
	The sign says "WELCOME".

(perform [read #loiteringplaque])
	The plaque says "NO LOITERING".
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(perform [read #welcomesign])</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">The sign says "WELCOME".</td></tr>
<tr><td class="blank" colspan="2"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(perform [read #loiteringplaque])</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">The plaque says "NO LOITERING".</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy8').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>There are two important differences between <span class="code">prevent</span> and
<span class="code">perform</span>: The first is that the sense of <span class="code">prevent</span> is
negated, meaning that the action fails when the predicate succeeds. The second
is that <span class="code">(stop)</span> is invoked automatically when a prevent-rule
succeeds. Thus, the above example (with a bit of surrounding context) could
lead to the following exchange:
</p>
<div class="blkoutput">&gt; READ ALL SIGNS<br />
Trying to read the large sign: The sign says "WELCOME".<br />
<br />
Trying to read the small brass plaque: The plaque says "NO LOITERING".</div><p>But the standard library contains a generic prevent-rule that causes
<span class="code">[read&nbsp;$]</span> to fail when the player is in a dark location.
Prevent-rules have precedence over perform-rules (this follows from the
implementation of <span class="code">(instead of $)</span> that we saw earlier), so if the
player attempts the same command in darkness, the process grinds to a halt
already after the first failed attempt:
</p>
<div class="blkoutput">&gt; READ ALL SIGNS<br />
Trying to read the large sign: It is too dark to read.</div><p>Recall that prevent-rules defined by the story take precedence over
prevent-rules defined by the standard library. Sometimes this is not desirable.
For instance, consider the following story-supplied rule:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy9" readonly>
(prevent [eat $])
	~(the player is hungry)
	You're not hungry.
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(prevent [eat $])</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">~(the player is hungry)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">You're not hungry.</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy9').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>Now, if the player attempts to eat a kerosene lamp, the game might refuse with
a message about the player not being hungry. It would be more natural, in this
case, to complain about the object not being edible, which is handled by a rule
in the standard library. To get around this problem, we may wish to intercept
perform instead of prevent:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy10" readonly>
(perform [eat $])
	~(the player is hungry)
	You're not hungry.
	(tick) (stop) %% These are our responsibility now.
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(perform [eat $])</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">~(the player is hungry)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">You're not hungry.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(tick) (stop) <span class="comment">&emsp;%% These are our responsibility now.</span></td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy10').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>Likewise, a story might contain situations where the prevent-perform dichotomy
breaks down, and it doesn't make sense to check for all the unsuccessful cases
before moving on to the successful cases. In such situations, it often makes
more sense to combine everything into a large
<span class="nobreak"><a href="control.html#if">if/elseif-complex</a></span> in a <span class="code">perform</span> rule. As long
as the unsuccessful branches end with <span class="nobreak"><span class="code">(tick)&nbsp;(stop)</span></span>,
that's a perfectly valid and useful approach in story code. In library code,
having separate prevent and perform stages is preferable, since that structure
is easier to adapt and extend from the outside.
</p>
<a id="narrate"></a><h2>Narration predicates</h2>
<p>We have seen how to override the <span class="code">perform</span> rule of a standard
library action, in order to do something else entirely. But what if you wish to
retain the default behaviour of an action, such as taking an object, and merely
add some flavour to the message that is printed? As we will see in the chapter
on <a href="stdactions.html">Standard actions</a>, the library defines eighteen <i>core
actions</i> that are capable of modifying the game world. Each of these actions
has a <span class="code">perform</span> rule that calls out to a specific <i>narration
predicate</i>, that you can intercept. Thus, for instance, the following saves
you the trouble of updating the object tree to reflect the new location of the
apple:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy11" readonly>
(narrate taking #apple)
	(#apple is pristine)
	You pluck the ripe fruit from the tree.
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(narrate taking #apple)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(#apple is pristine)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">You pluck the ripe fruit from the tree.</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy11').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>Likewise, some of the standard actions for exploring the game world call out to
action-specific predicates, partly to save typing on the part of the story
author, and partly to perform extra work before or afterwards:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy12" readonly>
(perform [examine #box])
	It's a small, wooden box.
	%% This works, but the rule head is cumbersome to type. It also
	%% inhibits the default behaviour of invoking '(appearance $ $ $)' for
	%% items inside the box.

(descr #box)
	It's a small, wooden box.
	%% This gets queried by the default perform-rule for examine.
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(perform [examine #box])</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">It's a small, wooden box.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="comment">%% This works, but the rule head is cumbersome to type. It also</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="comment">%% inhibits the default behaviour of invoking '(appearance $ $ $)' for</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="comment">%% items inside the box.</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="blank" colspan="2"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(descr #box)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">It's a small, wooden box.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="comment">%% This gets queried by the default perform-rule for examine.</span></td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy12').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<a id="diversion"></a><h2>Diversion</h2>
<p>Quite often, the action as reported by the parser could be understood as a
roundabout way of expressing a different action. Thus, climbing a staircase in
a particular location might be a natural way for the player to express a desire
to <span class="code">[go&nbsp;#up]</span>. Certainly, it should not be interpreted as a request
to place the player character on top of the staircase object. A
well-implemented story will handle these cases transparently, by transforming
what the player wrote into what the player intended. This is called
<i>diverting</i> the action, and it is achieved by intercepting the
<span class="code">(instead of&nbsp;$)</span> rule, and querying <span class="code">(try&nbsp;$)</span> with the
desired action. This circumvents the normal prevent-checks, which is good:
After all, we don't want the standard library to complain about the staircase
not being an actor supporter.
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy13" readonly>
(instead of [climb #staircase])
	(current room #bottomOfStairs)
	(try [go #up])

(instead of [climb #staircase])
	(current room #topOfStairs)
	(try [go #down])
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(instead of [climb #staircase])</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(current room #bottomOfStairs)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(try [go #up])</td></tr>
<tr><td class="blank" colspan="2"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(instead of [climb #staircase])</td></tr>

<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(try [go #down])</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy13').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>There is a subtlety here, related to how time is advanced in the game world:
The general rule is that code that queries <span class="code">(try $)</span> is responsible
for also calling <span class="code">(tick)</span> afterwards. But when we divert to a
different action, we're already inside an action handler, so we trust that
whatever code queried us, is eventually going to query <span class="code">(tick)</span> as
well.
</p>
<p>Stories may invoke <span class="code">(try&nbsp;$)</span> directly to inject actions into the
gameplay, e.g. as part of a cutscene. This is typically done at the end of a
cutscene, followed by <span class="nobreak"><span class="code">(tick)&nbsp;(stop)</span></span>.
</p>
<a id="refusebefore"></a><h2>Refuse and before</h2>
<p>Now let's return to the two remaining action-handling predicates:
<span class="code">refuse</span> and <span class="code">before</span>. Consider this an advanced topic:
Most of the time, story authors won't need to deal with these predicates
directly.
</p>
<p>To understand how they fit into the picture, we'll first take a look at the
rule definition for <span class="code">(try&nbsp;$)</span>, as it is given in the standard
library:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy14" readonly>
(try $Action)
	~{ (refuse $Action) (stop) }
	(exhaust) *(before $Action)
	~{ (refuse $Action) (stop) }
	(instead of $Action)
(try $)
	%% Succeed anyway.
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(try $Action)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">~{ (refuse $Action) (stop) }</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(exhaust) *(before $Action)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">~{ (refuse $Action) (stop) }</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(instead of $Action)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(try $)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="comment">%% Succeed anyway.</span></td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy14').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>If <span class="code">refuse</span> succeeds, all subsequent action handling stops. Time
is not advanced. The default implementation of <span class="code">refuse</span> checks that
all objects mentioned in the action (except directions and relations) are
within reach of the current player character. If they're not,
<span class="code">refuse</span> prints a message about it and succeeds, just like a
<span class="code">prevent</span> rule. The reason for having two different rules (refuse
and prevent), is that it's generally a good idea to check for reachability
first. The action-specific prevent-rules are then free to phrase their failure
messages in a way that presupposes reachability (e.g. &ldquo;the door is
locked&rdquo;, which you wouldn't know if you couldn't reach it).
</p>
<p>Some actions do not require every object to be within reach. The most common
way to modify <span class="code">refuse</span> is to add a <a href="control.html#negation">negated rule
definition</a>. So, for instance, examining does not require reachability:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy15" readonly>
~(refuse [examine $]) %% Don't refuse.
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">~(refuse [examine $]) <span class="comment">&emsp;%% Don't refuse.</span></td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy15').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>Another option is to require reachability for one object, but not the other.
Here's a snippet from the standard library:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy16" readonly>
(refuse [throw $Obj at $Target])
	(just)
	{
		(when $Obj is not here)
		(or) (when $Target is not here)
		(or) (when $Obj is out of reach)
	}
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(refuse [throw $Obj at $Target])</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(just)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">{</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="tab"> </span>(when $Obj is not here)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="tab"> </span>(or) (when $Target is not here)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right"><span class="tab"> </span>(or) (when $Obj is out of reach)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">}</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy16').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>The above code makes queries to <i>when-predicates</i>; these check for common
error conditions and print appropriate messages. The full set of
when-predicates is documented in <a href="miscfeat.html#commoncomplaints">Chapter&nbsp;10</a>.
</p>
<p>Also note the <a href="choicepoints.html#just"><span class="code">(just)</span> keyword</a>, which turns off the
default <span class="nobreak"><span class="code">refuse</span>-</span>rule that is defined later in the
source code.
</p>
<p>When a story overrides <span class="code">refuse</span>, the parameter is often bound to a
specific object. So, for instance, a rain cloud in the sky might be out of the
player character's reach, But <span class="prginput">RAIN</span> would be understood as
referring to the cloud. In order to allow <span class="prginput">DRINK RAIN</span>, we might
want to make an exception:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy17" readonly>
~(refuse [drink #cloud])

(instead of [drink #cloud])
	You catch a raindrop on your tongue.
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">~(refuse [drink #cloud])</td></tr>
<tr><td class="blank" colspan="2"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(instead of [drink #cloud])</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">You catch a raindrop on your tongue.</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy17').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p>Note that we also decided to bypass the normal prevent-checks by intercepting
<span class="code">instead&nbsp;of</span> rather than <span class="code">perform</span>. Another option would
be to declare the cloud to be <span class="code">(potable&nbsp;$)</span>.
</p>
<p>Finally, <span class="nobreak"><span class="code">before</span>-</span>rules smoothen gameplay by taking
care of certain well-known prerequisite actions. Thus, if the player attempts
to go through a closed door, the game will automatically attempt to open it
first. And before that, if the door is locked and the player holds the right
key, an attempt is made to unlock the door. <span class="code">Try</span> exhausts every
branch of the <span class="code">*(before&nbsp;$)</span> <a href="choicepoints.html#multiqueries">multi-query</a>, so there
can be several before-rules for any given action.
</p>
<p>By convention, before-rules should use <span class="code">(first try&nbsp;$)</span> to launch the
prerequisite actions:
</p>
<textarea class="copyarea" id="copy18" readonly>
(before [remove #socks])
	(#shoes is #wornby #hero)
	(first try [remove #shoes])
</textarea>
<div class="blkcode">
<table>
<tr><td class="both" colspan="2">(before [remove #socks])</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(#shoes is #wornby #hero)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="right">(first try [remove #shoes])</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="copycode">
<a class="copybtn" href="" onClick="document.getElementById('copy18').select(); document.execCommand('copy'); return false;">[Copy to clipboard]</a>
</div>
<p><span class="code">(first try $)</span> prints the familiar &ldquo;(first attempting
<span class="nobreak">to&nbsp;<i>...</i>)&rdquo;</span> message, before querying <span class="code">(try&nbsp;$)</span>,
and then <span class="code">(tick)</span>. Ticking is important here, because opening a door
and entering the door should consume two units of time, even when the opening
action is triggered automatically by the game.

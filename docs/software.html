<p>An archive containing the latest version of Dialog can be found here:
</p>
<p class="indented"><a href="https://linusakesson.net/dialog/">https://linusakesson.net/dialog/</a>
</p>
<p>The archive contains the full source code for the Dialog compiler and
interactive debugger, as well as pre-built executable files for Linux (i386 and
x86_64) and Windows. The compiler is called <span class="tt">dialogc</span>, and the debugger
is called <span class="tt">dgdebug</span>.
</p>
<p>Both the compiler and the interactive debugger have to be started from a
commandline shell. Depending on what operating system you use, you may have to
copy the executable files to a system-specific location, or simply navigate to
the directory that contains them.
</p>
<p>The Windows version of the debugger makes use of a third-party library,
<i>Windows&nbsp;Glk</i> by David Kinder. Make sure to put the two included
<span class="tt">DLL</span> files in the same directory as the executable file
(<span class="tt">dgdebug.exe</span>).
</p>
<p>To check that everything is in place, try the following two commands:
</p>
<div class="blkoutput">dialogc --version<br />
dgdebug --version</div><p>Each of them should print the current version number of the Dialog software.
The first two characters (a digit and a letter) identify the language version,
which is currently <b>0e</b>. Following that is a slash, and then the software
revision number.
</p>
<p>The archive also contains the latest version of the Dialog standard library,
<span class="tt">stdlib.dg</span>, and the standard debugging library extension,
<span class="tt">stddebug.dg</span>. You should make local copies of these files for each of
your projects, because if you ever wish to rebuild your story in the future,
you'll want to have access to the exact version of the library you used. Also,
you may wish to make story-specific modifications to the library.
</p>
<p>A copy of this manual is also included in the archive, and a file called
<span class="nobreak"><span class="tt">license.txt</span></span> that details how you may use the software. In
short, you have the right to use, modify, and redistribute the compiler and
standard library (with or without source code), in whole or in part, as long as
attribution is given.
</p>
<a id="compiler"></a><h2>The compiler</h2>
<p>Dialog is a compiled language. Source code is stored in text files with the
filename extension <span class="tt">.dg</span>. When international characters are used, they
must be encoded in UTF-8. The compiler delivers its output in <span class="tt">.zblorb</span>,
<span class="tt">.z8</span>, or <span class="tt">.z5</span> format. When the zblorb format is chosen, the
compiler can optionally include cover art with the story, but this feature is
not regarded as a part of the Dialog language itself.
</p>
<div class="img"><img src="overview.png" /></div>
<p>To compile a Dialog story into <span class="tt">zblorb</span> format, invoke the compiler with
the source code filenames as arguments, and optionally use
<span class="nobreak"><span class="tt">-o</span></span> to specify an output filename. The default output
filename is constructed from the name of the first source code file, combined
with a filename extension that is appropriate for the current output format.
</p>
<p>The order of source code filenames is important. The story must appear before
the standard library, and any extensions (such as the standard debugging
library) should appear in between. For instance:
</p>
<p><span class="tt">dialogc story.dg stddebug.dg stdlib.dg</span>
</p>
<p>This will produce a file called <span class="tt">story.zblorb</span>, based on the name of the
first source code file.
</p>
<p>The example games in this manual do not declare IFIDs, which is mandatory when
the zblorb output format is used. To compile the examples, you must ask the
compiler to emit raw z8 (or&nbsp;z5) code by adding <span class="nobreak"><span class="tt">-t&nbsp;z8</span></span>
<span class="nobreak">(or <span class="tt">-t&nbsp;z5</span>)</span> to the command line:
</p>
<p><span class="tt">dialogc -t z8 example.dg stdlib.dg</span>
</p>
<p>This will produce a file called <span class="tt">example.z8</span>.
</p>
<p>The examples in Part&nbsp;I do not make use of the standard library at all, so they
are compiled like this:
</p>
<p><span class="tt">dialogc -t z8 example.dg</span>
</p>
<p>When you use the <span class="tt">z5</span> output format, the resulting file is limited to
256&nbsp;KiB, compared to 512&nbsp;KiB for <span class="tt">z8</span>. However, the <span class="tt">z5</span> format
is more compact, and switching to this format can reduce the size of the story
file by about 5%.
</p>
<p>The <span class="nobreak"><span class="tt">-v</span></span> flag makes the compiler more verbose. Give it
once, and the compiler will print the wordcount for your story, as well as some
technical stats. Give it twice <span class="nobreak">(<span class="tt">-vv</span>)</span> and the compiler
will dump additional information that can be useful for debugging.
</p>
<p>To see the full list of options supported by <span class="tt">dialogc</span>, type:
</p>
<p><span class="tt">dialogc --help</span>
</p>
<a id="dgdebug"></a><h2>The interactive debugger</h2>
<p>This section uses terminology that may be confusing if you've only just started
to learn about Dialog. Please skim through the section anyway, because having a
back-of-the-mind awareness of these techniques can be very helpful later.
</p>
<p>We've seen that the role of the <a href="software.html#compiler">compiler</a> is to convert your
Dialog program into a compact, widely-supported runtime format. In contrast,
the <i>interactive debugger</i> runs your game directly from source code, and
allows you to inspect and manipulate the program while it is running.
</p>
<div class="img"><img src="debugger.png" /></div>
<p>To debug your game, launch the debugger from the commandline with your source
code filenames as arguments:
</p>
<p><span class="tt">dgdebug story.dg stdlib.dg</span>
</p>
<p>The order of the filenames is significant, just like when compiling.
</p>
<p>The debugger also accepts a couple of commandline options. For a complete list,
type:
</p>
<p><span class="tt">dgdebug --help</span>
</p>
<h3>Running the game</h3>
<p>At startup, the debugger analyzes your program, reporting any compilation
errors. If everything looks fine, it launches the program. You can then play
your game normally.
</p>
<p>When the game is asking for input, you may instead choose to type an arbitrary
<a href="execution.html#predsrules">query</a>, <a href="choicepoints.html#multiqueries">multi-query</a>, or
<a href="dynamic.html">now-statement</a>. This can be used to inspect or control the running
program.
</p>
<p>The debugger remains operational after your program terminates. To start over,
type <span class="code">(restart)</span>. To quit the debugger, either press Control-D
(Linux), close the window (Windows), or type the special command
<span class="tt">@quit</span>.
</p>
<h3>Modifying a running game</h3>
<p>The interactive debugger watches your source code files for changes. New code
is merged into the running program automatically, so you can test new
functionality without restarting the game.
</p>
<p>If there are compilation errors in the new version of the source code, the
debugger will report them and put the execution on hold until you've fixed
them.
</p>
<p>Any <a href="dynamic.html">dynamic predicates</a> that have changed during gameplay retain
their value, so that e.g. the player character remains in the current room,
with any picked-up objects still in their inventory. But unchanged dynamic
predicates will reflect the initial value declarations as they're given in the
new version of the source code.
</p>
<p>The debugger also tries to match <a href="control.html#select">select statements</a> in the old and
new versions of the code, in order to make the transition as seamless as
possible. But you may occasionally find that a select statement has been reset.
</p>
<p>Be aware that by modifying the source code, you can introduce new
<a href="execution.html#parameters">objects</a> and <a href="varsvalues.html#values">dictionary words</a>, but you can't
remove them. This affects the operation of the built-in <span class="code">(object&nbsp;$)</span>
predicate, as well as <span class="code">(get input&nbsp;$)</span>, with particular consequences
for games that use the <a href="builtins.html#input">removable word endings</a> feature. To remove
extraneous objects and dictionary words, use <span class="code">(restart)</span> (or
<span class="tt">@replay</span>; see below).
</p>
<h3>Debugging commands</h3>
<p>In addition to arbitrary queries and now-statements, the debugger allows you to
type <i>debugging commands</i> at the game prompt. These are recognized by a
leading <span class="tt">@</span> character.
</p>
<p>The debugger maintains a list of all <i>accumulated input</i> that you've typed
into the running program. Only proper input counts, not queries or debugging
commands. The list is cleared on restart, and trimmed on undo, so in that sense
it represents a straight path from the beginning of the game to the current
game state. The following debugging commands make use of it:
</p>
<p class="codeline"><span class="tt">@replay</span></p>
<p class="noteline">Resets the game, and re-enters all accumulated input. This will
normally reproduce the current game position from a clean start, but it
may work differently if you've made changes to the source code, or if
the game includes randomized behaviour. It can be useful for catching
unintended non-local effects of a code change.
</p>
<p class="codeline"><span class="tt">@again</span></p>
<p class="noteline">Performs an undo operation, and then re-enters the most recent line of
input. This command offers more fine-grained control than
<span class="tt">@replay</span>, and generally works better for games with randomized
behaviour. It lets you focus on the local effects of a code change.
</p>
<p class="codeline"><span class="tt">@g</span></p>
<p class="noteline">A synonym for <span class="tt">@again</span>.
</p>
<p class="codeline"><span class="tt">@save</span></p>
<p class="noteline">Saves the accumulated input as a simple text file. The debugger will
ask you for a filename.
</p>
<p class="codeline"><span class="tt">@restore</span></p>
<p class="noteline">Resets the game, and reads input from a text file, thus recreating the
saved game position. The debugger will ask you for a filename.
</p>
<p>You can get a full list of debugging commands by typing <span class="tt">@help</span> at the
prompt. These commands can be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is unique;
<span class="tt">@h</span> works for <span class="tt">@help</span>, for instance.
</p>
<h3>Suspending execution</h3>
<p>The terminal version of the debugger (i.e. <i>not</i> the Windows&nbsp;Glk version)
allows you to suspend a running computation by pressing Control-C at any time.
This will immediately take you to a prompt where you can type queries and
debugging commands.
</p>
<p>To resume execution, type a blank line at this prompt.
</p>
<p>Suspending is useful when you've enabled <a href="builtins.html#trace">tracing</a> and found that you
got a bit more than you bargained for. At the <span class="tt">[More]</span> prompt, simply
hit Control-C, type <span class="code">(trace&nbsp;off)</span>, and press return a second time.
</p>
<p>It can also be used to escape from an accidental infinite loop, using
<span class="code">(stop)</span>. This is rarely needed, however, because the debugger does
not perform tail-call optimization, and there's a limit on the number of
recursive calls.
</p>
<h3>Some useful debugging techniques</h3>
<p>Use queries to inspect the state of the running program, e.g. type
<span class="code">*($&nbsp;has parent #box)</span> into the game to get a list of every object
that's currently a direct child of the <span class="code">#box</span> object.
</p>
<p>The standard library provides <span class="code">(actions&nbsp;on)</span> and
<span class="code">(actions&nbsp;off)</span>, for controlling <i>action tracing</i>. When
enabled, this feature makes the library print the names of
<a href="actions.html">actions</a> as it tries them.
</p>
<p>The library also provides <span class="code">(scope)</span>, for listing every object that's
currently <a href="moving.html#scope">in&nbsp;scope</a>.
</p>
<p>The following predicates are highly useful for manipulating the state of the
running game:
</p>
<p class="codeline">(enter <i>Room</i>)</p>
<p class="noteline">to teleport the player character to a given room,
</p>
<p class="codeline">(now) (<i>Object</i> is #heldby <i>Player</i>)</p>
<p class="noteline">to purloin an object, and
</p>
<p class="codeline">(try <i>Action</i>)</p>
<p class="noteline">to temporarily sidestep a parser problem.
</p>
<p>Query tracing can be enabled interactively with <span class="code">(trace&nbsp;on)</span>, and
disabled with <span class="code">(trace&nbsp;off)</span>. Tracing a complete player command will
produce a lot of output as the command is parsed. Sometimes it makes more sense
to temporarily add <span class="code">(trace&nbsp;on)</span> and <span class="code">(trace&nbsp;off)</span> to the
source code, surrounding the particular bit that you're interested in.
Remember, the debugger lets you do this while the program is running.
</p>
<p>Use the built-in predicate <span class="code">(breakpoint)</span> to suspend the program
from within the source code, in order to inspect the game state at arbitrary
points during execution.
</p>
<p>The command <span class="prginput">AGAIN</span> (or <span class="prginput">G</span>) lets the player repeat
the last line of input. During development, you will often want to change
something in the most recent response, and then retry the action to
see what the new version looks like. <span class="prginput">AGAIN</span> usually works for
this, but there's a snag: If you've added new dictionary words, e.g. by
changing a <span class="code">(dict&nbsp;$)</span> rule, then a regular <span class="prginput">AGAIN</span> will
fail to pick up the new words. Use the up-arrow to fetch the command from the
input history instead. Another option is to use the debugging command
<span class="tt">@again</span> (or <span class="tt">@g</span>), which will handle this corner-case
transparently. That command also performs an implicit undo, which is
particularly useful for debugging games with timed puzzles.
</p>
<p>Finally, a word of warning: The interactive debugger does not try to emulate
the Z-machine compiler backend. The Z-machine truncates dictionary words, but
the debugger doesn't. The debugger allocates larger heap areas, but doesn't
optimize tail calls. Always test the compiled version of your game thoroughly,
in a Z-code interpreter, before releasing it.
</p>
<a id="buildtools"></a><h2>Building from source code</h2>
<p>To build the Dialog compiler and debugger from source, you need a working
C&nbsp;compiler (such as <span class="tt">gcc</span> or <span class="tt">clang</span>) and some version of the
make command (such as <span class="tt">gmake</span>). Unpack the archive, enter the
<span class="tt">src</span> directory, and type &ldquo;<span class="tt">make</span>&rdquo;. If all went well, you
should now have two executable files called <span class="tt">dialogc</span> and
<span class="tt">dgdebug</span> in the current directory. These are the compiler and debugger,
respectively.
</p>
<p>If you are on a Unix-like system, and you wish to install the tools in a
system-wide location, type &ldquo;<span class="tt">sudo&nbsp;make&nbsp;install</span>&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>The Windows binaries can be cross-compiled on a Linux system using the
<span class="tt">Mingw32</span> toolchain.
